### The Mission

> Liberty Spark cultivates, curates, and accelerates Airmen’s ideas to shape tomorrow’s Warfighter today.

Liberty Spark embodies the vision of senior leaders to inspire a culture of innovation, leverage the ingenuity of Airmen, and empower them, at the unit-level, to swiftly advance development and implementation of solutions to warfighter needs. Liberty Spark cultivates, curates, and accelerates Airmen’s ideas to shape tomorrow’s Warfighter today.

The Liberty Spark Cell is a learning program continually evolving through experience. Often, innovation is successfully implemented through the thoughtful application of improved engineering and technology processes and services. To facilitate this endeavor, the 48 FW established the Liberty Spark Cell to provide a rapid, representative decision-making body to address resourcing unit-level innovation initiatives. The focus of the Liberty Spark Cell is to identify innovation initiatives and develop resource options to facilitate rapid project start-up within units. By bringing together numerous resources, Liberty Spark seeks to aid Airmen motivated to innovate and improve processes within their units.

By providing trained Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) facilitators, funding, mentorship, and connections to a growing network of innovation programs, Liberty Spark will assist Airmen in the development of their ideas and promote leadership engagement to overcome barriers to implementation. More specifically, the Spark Cell is needed to develop RAF Lakenheath Airmen’s ideas into powerful operational realities.

### Our Vision

**Cultivate** innovative Airmen’s problems and ideas and enable them to perform tactical experiments by connecting them with operators, acquisition officers, senior leaders, and commercial innovators

**Curate** ideas into ‘internal startups’ that experiment on the operational level by adding funding, building teams, and demonstrating with stakeholders on a part-time or temporary basis.

**Accelerate** the most promising ‘internal startups’ to become permanently sustained within the Air and Space Force by allowing the teams to work full time to implement, operationalize and transition their vision.
