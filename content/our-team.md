Liberty Spark is a diverse group of impossibly talented and endlessly passionate servants united to meet a common goal: Innovate the Wing! We are here to save Airmen time, save the Air Force money, increase our mission’s efficiency, and ignite a competitive culture of innovation at RAF Lakenheath, England. Rank is set aside, and all members converge to meet the needs of our innovators by leveraging the ingenuity of Air Fore intrapreneurs at the base level and non-traditional partners.

### Engagement

The heart and soul of Liberty Spark, the Engagement Team heads up Unit-Level engagement through volunteer Innovation Coaches and Consultants. This team sources problems and ideas to support “bottom-up projects” and assist teams in forming “innovation start-ups”. The team also leads workshops, sprint sessions, and engages with their leadership to offer resources and backyard innovation updates

### Capabilities

This is where the fun stuff takes place. This team takes problems and ideas sourced from our Engagement Team and provides unit-level start-ups with both a space and resources to experiment and accelerate their ideas. This team heads up the Spark Lab known as “Lab48”.

### Transition

Takes proven and viable project experiment and transitions at scale. This team engages with industry, academia, and a host of partners to get Airmen’s ideas into the operational environment through SBIR and STTR services. The Transition Team doesn't just bridge gaps, they lay the infrastructure for true multi-domain collaboration.
