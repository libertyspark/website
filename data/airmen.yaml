    description: In an era of great power competition, our squadrons, more than ever, are the heartbeat of the Air Force. To foster innovation at the level of command that makes the most significant impact, CSAF General Charles Q. Brown Jr. and Secretary of The Air Force Barbara M. Barrett championed the fourth year of Squadron Innovation Funds (SIF) for fiscal year 2021 so commanders can tackle their most pressing readiness and national security challenges. In keeping with previous guidance, we must continue to THINK BIG, start small, and Scale Fast. To learn more about SIF, check out our USAF Liberty Spark Team SharePoint, or swing by the innovation lab.

  - title: AFWERX
    description: AFWERX is a network of people who want to help create a better Air Force for all Airmen. Some innovators work for AFWERX full-time, others who take on passion projects outside of their traditional jobs and tap into the AFWERX ecosystem for support, and plenty more who collaborate with us as part of their position at Air Force bases around the world. Because AFWERX is fueled by people with a diverse set of skills, passions, and roles in the Air Force, the list of initiatives and resources we have access to is always growing. The following outline of Airmen resources is not all-inclusive. Still, it is a starting point for understanding the AFWERX ecosystem and how to use it at your units, wings, major commands, and within the Air Force as a whole.
